note:
app.js
  has state as user 
that user need to have information
app.js has setUser function that set the state when you pass the user object in user is an object. you need to curly braces because other wise state = user 
user == m.... is not object?  how about message alerts? .... 
just remember setState({ forNOw. })

anyway it sill st state the user information will be receive from  prop signin. 

sigin will receive from user form submit whne submit it will update state how? as it type it will update automaticlly by using onchang event.target.name event.targe. value.
